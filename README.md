## Overview

This project implements an hourly electricity consumption forecasting model using smart meter readings and weather station data. It trains and evaluates three machine learning models (**Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Gradient Boosting**) on a 7-feature dataset. 

Because the feature set includes the physical electrical variable **`Current Intensity (A)`**, the models achieve near-perfect prediction metrics (**R² = 99.96%**), directly modeling the physical law of electrical power. The project is served via a lightweight **FastAPI backend API** and an interactive, beautifully designed **Single Page Application (SPA)** dashboard.

## Objectives

1. Develop a high-accuracy machine learning model for predicting hourly active household power consumption ($kW$).
2. Analyze the impact of weather conditions, seasonal patterns, and past consumption behavior on electrical demand.
3. Serve predictions, base model comparisons, and step-by-step mathematical calculations in an interactive web dashboard.

## Dataset Description

| Dataset | Source | Granularity | Date Range | Key Columns |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **household_power_consumption.csv** | UCI ML Repository | Minute-level | Dec 2006 – Dec 2008 | `Global_active_power` (Target), `Voltage`, `Global_intensity`, `Sub_metering_1/2` |
| **sceaux_weather_data.csv** | Meteostat | Daily | Dec 2006 – Nov 2010 | `tavg`, `wdir`, `wspd` |

After resampling the smart meter readings to hourly averages and merging them with forward-filled weather station records, the final cleaned dataset contains **17,453 hourly rows** spanning Dec 2006 to Dec 2008.

## Feature Space (7 Selected Features)

To achieve maximum accuracy while keeping the dashboard intuitive, the models are trained on exactly **7 features** (Layer 2 naming convention):

| Feature Name | Description | Source |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Temperature (°C)** | Average hourly temperature | Weather station (`tavg`) |
| **Hour of Day** | Hour index (0–23) representing daily usage cycles | DateTime Engineering |
| **Season** | Season index (0=Winter, 1=Spring, 2=Summer, 3=Autumn) | DateTime Engineering |
| **Voltage (V)** | Average hourly electrical line voltage | Smart Meter (`Voltage`) |
| **Consumption 1 Hour Ago (kW)** | Power consumption in the previous hour (Lag 1) | Smart Meter (`Global_active_power`) |
| **Consumption 24 Hours Ago (kW)** | Power consumption at the same hour yesterday (Lag 24) | Smart Meter (`Global_active_power`) |
| **Current Intensity (A)** | Average hourly electrical current draw | Smart Meter (`Global_intensity`) |

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanjith-sanil/EnergyPredictionML.git
   cd EnergyPredictionML
   ```
2. **Download the dataset**:
   Place the raw `household_power_consumption.csv` file into the project root directory.
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

### Step 1: Train the Models
Run the training pipeline script to aggregate the dataset, tune hyperparameters, select the best model, and save files to `models/` and `plots/`:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Start the Web Server
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --port 8000
```
Open **`http://localhost:8000`** in your browser to access the dashboard.

## Model Evaluation Results

Due to the physical linear relationship between active power, voltage, and current intensity ($P = V \times I$), all models achieve near-perfect evaluation scores:

| Model | MAE (kW) | RMSE (kW) | R² Score | MAPE (%) |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 🏆 **Gradient Boosting** *(Selected Best)* | **0.0134** | **0.0186** | **99.96% (0.9996)** | **2.46%** |
| 🌲 **Linear Regression** | 0.0172 | 0.0226 | 99.94% (0.9994) | 2.94% |
| ⚡ **Random Forest** | 0.0181 | 0.0370 | 99.83% (0.9983) | 3.01% |

*Note: The FastAPI Predict page uses the best overall model (Gradient Boosting) to calculate power outputs. For transparency, it also displays a KaTeX equation and a step-by-step contribution breakdown using the highly interpretable weights of the Linear Regression model.*
